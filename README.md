# Denis Nadarevic - @bigboydeku 🎉
Hi 👋, I'm Denis -- A recent University of Windsor graduate with a passion for developing useful applications. Whether it's a full stack project or a silly application, every repo is a new challenge. My wonderful team and I led Windsor's first online mobility hackathon, WinHacks, and are currently working on a cross-border hackathon to inspire tech talent in our communities. I am a huge K-pop fan and an avid gamer (League and Valorant!).

## Values/Outlook
🤝 Trustworthy and willing to get the job done<br>
✏️ Motivated to learn anything <br>
😊 Easy to get along with <br>
🎉 Enjoying life and having fun <br>
  
 ## How I work
 I'm a simple man; give me an idea and freedom to approach it any way and I can take on any challenge. I am obsessed with being organized to the point where its scary! Oh, and money is a big motivator for me! 🤑
